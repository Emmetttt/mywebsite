		    Welcome to my website. I am an Astrophysics graduate from the University of Liverpool.

		   	I have created this webpage as a place to develop any ideas I have. Check out my blogs for explanations of projects I am working on. The music grapher section is a project I made to plot the acclaim of a band or artist over their career by looking at how well each album was received. The links section is just for useful links for when I'm away from my computer.
